# Text-Game
The final project for CPSC 120 
I coded this project in Visual Studio. 

To run, just click the green arrow button, and it will open the file in the terminal. 
Follow the instructions displayed on the screen to play. 

In case you don't run it on Visual Studio:
run g++ noReturn.cpp
./a.out

Have fun !
